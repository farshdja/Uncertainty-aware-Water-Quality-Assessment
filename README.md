# Uncertainty-aware-Water-Quality-Assessment
Here, we introduced an innovative framework for Water Quality Index (WQI) assessment that directly incorporates data uncertainty to improve the reliability of WQ evaluations. This function performs a comprehensive analysis of water quality data, incorporating Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) fitting, Uncertainty-aware Principal Component Analysis (UPCA), weight computation, Water Quality Index (WQI) calculation, and Sobol Sensitivity Analysis. The primary objectives are: 1. Examine the effect of different levels of uncertainty in water quality data on the results of the principal component analysis. 2. Quantify the impact of parameter uncertainty on the WQI due to the uncertainty of the input data. 3. Identify, through sensitivity analysis, which quality parameters significantly contribute to the propagation of uncertainty in the WQI at each monitoring station.
